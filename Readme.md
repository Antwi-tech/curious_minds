# Scheduler Database Documentation

## Overview

This database schema powers the **Scheduler System**, where **companies** create available time slots and **schools** can book those slots. An **admin** manages and verifies all accounts before they become active.

The schema is implemented in **MySQL** and uses foreign keys to maintain relational integrity.
